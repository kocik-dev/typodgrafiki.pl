# Grzegorz Kocik &#8226; Portfolio
## _Front-end developer | UI Designer_

### Introduction
The project is my personal portfolio website. I have included information about myself, my sample works, and demonstrations of my skills on the website. The site is built using React, and deliberately avoids the use of unnecessary external libraries to showcase my code. The only external packages used are [Normalize] for CSS reset, and [Emailjs] for sending emails from the contact form.

### Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

### Used Libraries
