# Animated Microinteractions in Ecommerce: How They Impact UX

Have you ever wondered what makes adding a product to the cart in one store feel exciting, while in another it feels mundane? The key might lie in microinteractions. These small, subtle animations may seem insignificant, but they actually impact UX more than you might think.

## What Are Microinteractions?

Microinteractions are animations that inform users about the completion of an action, such as:

-   Confirmation: After clicking the "add to cart" button, you see an animated cart.
-   Attracting attention: Subtle pulsing of a CTA button.
-   Navigation aid: A visual cue indicating that something has been updated.

## Why Does It Work?

-   **The human mind likes feedback** – Animations give users a signal that something has happened.
-   **Increased engagement** – Users spend more time in the store.
-   **Building emotion** – Small effects can evoke joy and satisfaction.

### Example: Pulsing Button

<CodeSnippet
    language="html"
    code={`<button class="add-to-cart">Dodaj do koszyka</button>`}
/>

<CodeSnippet
    language="css"
    code={`.add-to-cart {
    background: #ff6f61;
    color: #fff;
    border: none;
    padding: 12px 20px;
    font-size: 18px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: transform 0.2s ease, box-shadow 0.2s ease;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.add-to-cart:active {
transform: translateY(2px) scale(0.98);
box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
`}
/>

## Practical Tips

-   **Don't overdo it** – Users don't need a strobe light on their screen. Subtlety is key!
-   **Test performance** – Ensure animations run smoothly on all devices.
-   **Focus on key actions** – Animate only the elements that influence conversions.
