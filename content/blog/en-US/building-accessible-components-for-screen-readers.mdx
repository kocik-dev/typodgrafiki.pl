# Building Accessible Components for Screen Readers

Have you ever wondered how visually impaired people use your application or website? Screen readers play a key role in this process. Well-designed components that are accessible to these tools can significantly improve user experience and make your application more inclusive.

## Why is Accessibility Important?

Designing accessible interfaces is not just an ethical and legal issue but also a UX consideration. Screen reader-friendly components:

- Improve user experience for people with disabilities.
- Facilitate navigation and interaction for all users, such as those using a keyboard.
- Can positively impact SEO since search engines appreciate semantic code.

## How to Create Accessible Components?

### 1. Use Proper HTML Tags

Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessibility. Instead of `<div>` and `<span>`, use native elements:

- `<button>` instead of a div mimicking a button,
- `<label>` for form field descriptions,
- `<nav>` to indicate navigation sections.

### 2. Use ARIA Attributes Only When Necessary

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) can help improve accessibility, but overuse can have negative effects. Key attributes include:

- `aria-label` – adds a description for an element,
- `aria-hidden="true"` – hides an element from screen readers,
- `role="alert"` – announces important changes on the page.

### 3. Ensure Logical Structure and Navigation Order

Screen readers rely on the DOM order, so you should:

- Use headings (`h1`-`h6`) in a hierarchical manner,
- Maintain a clear tab order (`tabindex`),
- Avoid hiding essential information visually.

### 4. Test with Screen Readers

The best way to check accessibility is by testing. Popular screen readers include:

- **NVDA** (Windows, free),
- **JAWS** (Windows, paid),
- **VoiceOver** (macOS/iOS),
- **TalkBack** (Android).

### 5. Example React Component

<CodeSnippet
    language="jsx"
    code={`import React from "react";

const AccessibleButton = ({ onClick }) => {
    return (
        <button 
            onClick={onClick}
            aria-label="Expand menu"
        >
            <span className="hamburger-line"></span>
            <span className="hamburger-line"></span>
            <span className="hamburger-line"></span>
        </button>
    );
};

export default AccessibleButton;`}
/>

## Conclusion

Accessibility is not an add-on but a fundamental aspect of good UX. By creating accessible components, you make your products more useful and inclusive. Remember to test, use semantic HTML, and apply ARIA attributes wisely.
